Features are listed in [features.md](/features.md)

## How to install ?
NOTE: As of 11/05/2024 or earlier, you can now opt to use ALEI in same place you check your map at.
You can use ALEI that way, but it is still RECOMMENDED to use ALEI by tampermonkey because ALEI also patches some functions AT PAGE start and has to run before ALE itself is loaded, but since script loads *after* ALE itself is loaded in opt-in way, some things might work LATER than expected, some things might also not work. (This includes ALEI's own mapdata parser.)

Easiest way to install ALEI is to use it inside Tampermonkey. You can download Tampermonkey from [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), then once you have installed Tampermonkey, you can download ALEI by clicking [here](https://github.com/LisABC/ALEI/raw/main/alei.user.js)

**NOTE:** Tampermonkey is the only natively supported userscript manager, you might have issues if you use others (Such as GreaseMonkey).
